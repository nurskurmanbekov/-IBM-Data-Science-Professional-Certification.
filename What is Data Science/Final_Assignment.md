<b>Based on the videos and the reading material, how would you define a data scientist and data science? (3 marks)</b>

A data scientist is a professional who is skilled in working with data, using statistical and machine learning techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data. They are responsible for collecting, cleaning, analyzing and interpreting data to inform business decisions. They should have strong analytical and problem-solving skills, as well as a good understanding of computer science, statistics and mathematical modeling. Data science, on the other hand, is a multi-disciplinary field that involves using statistical, computational, and subject-specific techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data. It involves the entire process of acquiring, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting data to provide meaningful insights and predictions. The ultimate goal of data science is to use data to make better decisions, support scientific discovery, and create new products and services.

<b>As discussed in the videos and the reading material, data science can be applied to problems across different industries. Give a brief explanation describing what industry  you are passionate about and would like to pursue a data science career in? (2 marks)</b>

I am interested in the healthcare and transportation industries.

<b>Based on the videos and the reading material, what are the ten main components of a report that would be delivered at the end of a data science project? (5 marks)</b>

The ten main components of a report that would be delivered at the end of a data science project are:

Executive Summary: A brief overview of the main findings and conclusions of the project.

Problem Statement: A description of the problem that the project is trying to solve.

Data Collection and Cleaning: A description of the data sources used and the process of cleaning and preprocessing the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): An analysis of the data to understand its distribution, relationships between variables, and potential outliers.

Methodology: A description of the methods used to analyze the data, including the statistical models, algorithms, and machine learning techniques used.

Results: A presentation of the results of the analysis, including visualizations, tables, and statistics.

Model Selection: A description of the process used to select the best model for the problem.

Model Validation: An evaluation of the performance of the selected model, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Deployment and Maintenance: A description of the deployment process and the steps necessary to maintain the model over time.

Conclusion: A summary of the main findings and a discussion of the implications and limitations of the project.
